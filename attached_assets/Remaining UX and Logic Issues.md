# Remaining UX and Logic Issues

## Major UX Issues

1. **WhatsApp Integration Incomplete**
   - The preferences page mentions SMS options, but WhatsApp is not explicitly implemented in the call configuration
   - Need to add WhatsApp as a distinct notification option throughout the application
   - Ensure consistency between preference settings and actual delivery options

2. **Progress Indicators Missing**
   - No clear indication of where users are in the onboarding journey
   - Users may not understand how many steps remain or how the steps relate to each other
   - A progress bar or step indicator would improve orientation

3. **Default Category Assignments**
   - Bank emails are automatically categorized in ways that may trigger unwanted calls
   - Need smarter default categorization that aligns with typical user preferences
   - High-priority defaults should be limited to truly urgent communications

4. **User Education Insufficient**
   - Limited explanation of what each category means and its implications
   - No tooltips or help text for complex configuration options
   - First-time users may be confused about the consequences of their choices

5. **Mobile Responsiveness Issues**
   - Complex grid layouts in the categorization and preferences screens may not work well on mobile
   - Some UI elements appear designed primarily for desktop
   - Need to ensure all functionality is accessible on smaller screens

## Logic and Implementation Issues

1. **State Persistence Between Screens**
   - Unclear if user selections persist properly when navigating between screens
   - Need to ensure preferences are saved even if users don't complete the entire flow
   - Back navigation should restore previous selections

2. **Category Learning Mechanism**
   - No clear indication that manual category adjustments inform future AI categorization
   - System should learn from user corrections to improve over time
   - Feedback loop implementation is unclear

3. **Email Refresh Mechanism**
   - No obvious way to refresh email data after initial scan
   - Users need a way to update categories as new emails arrive
   - Periodic background scanning would improve user experience

4. **Call Scheduling Logic**
   - Call scheduling appears to be immediate rather than recurring
   - Need clearer options for recurring vs. one-time calls
   - Calendar integration for scheduling would be beneficial

5. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - Limited feedback for API failures or processing errors
   - No clear recovery path if email scanning fails
   - Need graceful degradation for all error scenarios

## Integration Issues

1. **Gmail API Rate Limits**
   - No visible handling of Gmail API rate limits
   - Large inboxes might exceed quotas
   - Need throttling and retry mechanisms

2. **Twilio Integration**
   - Call scheduling appears to be UI-only without clear Twilio integration
   - Need to ensure proper phone number validation and formatting
   - International calling considerations are not addressed

3. **ElevenLabs Voice Generation**
   - Voice preview functionality is simulated rather than using actual ElevenLabs API
   - Need to implement actual voice sample generation
   - Voice style selection should provide audio examples

4. **Authentication Flow**
   - Gmail authentication appears simplified
   - Need to ensure proper OAuth token handling and refresh
   - User session management across the application

These issues should be prioritized based on their impact on the core user experience and the buildathon requirements. The most critical are the WhatsApp integration, default category assignments, and progress indicators, as these directly address the feedback in the transcript.
