## 🎯 Vision

To build a **GenAI-powered productivity concierge** for ambitious founders — one that understands their inbox chaos, pokes them to focus, calls them to remind, and adapts to their preferences in a voice-first, quirky, zero-effort interface.

---

## 🔥 What We’re Solving

Founders are flooded with:

* Missed meetings, newsletters, workshop confirmations
* Subscriptions they forgot about
* Junk from tools they never use

Yet productivity apps feel like more work. PookAi flips that. We call you. You talk. We act.

## 💡 Prompt for Smart Coding Agents

> You’re helping build **PookAi**, a voice-first AI concierge for founders. It scans inboxes, filters email sources, and lets users decide how they want to be reminded — via calls, alerts, or not at all. Use dark-mode UI inspired by Unroll.me. Quirky filter tags help classify senders. Calls are made via Twilio + ElevenLabs. Inbox parsing uses the Gmail inbox GitHub repo. Frontend is ShadCN+Tailwind+TS. Backend will be plugged by Tushar. For now, use dummy JSON but match final data schema. Focus on fast UI setup, natural UX, and quirky tone. This app *should feel like a productivity sidekick.*

---

## 📈 What Comes Next

### Phase 2

* Inbox cleanup automation
* Smart unsubscribe
* Slack or Notion integrations

### Phase 3

* AI mood setting: assistant can be “strict,” “casual,” or “funny”
* Habit tracking based on user patterns
* Rewards system for streaks of completed reminders

---

## 👑 Our Edge

* Voice-first. Inbox-zero without screen-time.
* Quirky, human tone. Productivity without sounding like a robot.
* Founder-built for founders.
