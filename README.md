# mailieAI - Intelligent Email Management Platform

> Built in 72 hours for #100xbuildathon - The AI-powered email concierge that startup founders actually need.

## üöÄ Vision & Problem Statement

**The Problem: Inbox Chaos is Killing Your Startup**

Picture this: It's 2 AM. You're finally done coding, product planning, or whatever founder chaos consumed your day. You check email "one last time" and see 247 unread messages. Your heart sinks.

**Buried in there somewhere are:**
- üî• A payment failure that's bleeding money
- üí∏ An investor trying to reach you about funding
- üò° An angry customer whose issue could tank your reputation
- üìÖ A board meeting you completely forgot about

**But also drowning the important stuff:**
- üì∞ 14 newsletters you subscribed to in a moment of "learning"
- üõçÔ∏è Promotional emails from every SaaS tool you've ever touched
- ü§ñ Automated notifications from services you forgot existed
- üìß LinkedIn messages from people trying to "connect"

## üí° Our Solution

mailieAI acts as your brutally honest email concierge, using AI to sort through the chaos with 5 quirky but effective categories:

1. **"Call Me For This"** - DROP EVERYTHING emails (investors, angry customers, payment failures)
2. **"Remind Me For This"** - Important founder stuff (board meetings, key hires, product launches)  
3. **"Keep But Don't Care"** - Useful but not urgent (industry news, tool updates)
4. **"Why Did I Sign Up For This?"** - Marketing emails from tools you use
5. **"Don't Tell Anyone"** - Complete garbage (spam, LinkedIn spam, conference invites you'll never attend)

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
docker run -d \
  --name mailieai-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mailieai \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:15

# Run the application
docker run -d \
  --name mailieai-app \

npm run db:push
```

3. **Start development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production Deployment

### Linux Server Deployment

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.24.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;

        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

## API Setup Requirements

### Gmail API Setup
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable Gmail API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:5000/api/callback`

### OpenAI API Setup

2. Generate API key
3. Add billing information (required for GPT-4)

### Twilio Setup
1. Create Twilio account
2. Purchase a phone number
3. Get Account SID and Auth Token
4. Configure webhook URLs if needed

## Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:
- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `email_senders` - Email senders and their categories
- `user_preferences` - User configuration settings
- `call_logs` - Voice call history
- `user_tokens` - OAuth tokens storage

## Health Checks

The application includes health check endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/health` - API health with database connectivity

## Monitoring

Monitor your deployment with:
```bash
# View application logs
docker-compose logs -f mailieai-app

# View database logs
docker-compose logs -f mailieai-postgres

# Check container status
docker-compose ps
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database connection issues**:
   - Verify DATABASE_URL in .env
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Check network connectivity between containers

2. **Gmail API errors**:
   - Verify Google OAuth credentials
   - Check redirect URI configuration
   - Ensure Gmail API is enabled

3. **Twilio call failures**:
   - Verify account balance
   - Check phone number format (+1234567890)
